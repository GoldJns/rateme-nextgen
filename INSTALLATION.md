## Prerequisites

Before starting with this project, ensure you have the following software installed and properly configured:

**Docker**
  - **Installation**: Docker allows you to package, distribute, and run applications in containers.
  - **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions.
  - [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Follow the guide specific to your operating system for Docker installation.

**Docker Compose**
  - **Purpose**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
  - **Included**: Often included in Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS.
  - [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/): Follow the guide to install Docker Compose if not included in your Docker installation.

**kubectl**
  - **Purpose**: `kubectl` is a command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
  - [kubectl Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/): Follow the guide specific to your operating system for `kubectl` installation.

**Java Development Kit (JDK)**
  - **Purpose**: Java Development Kit is required for running Java applications.
  - [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/): Download and install the JDK appropriate for your operating system.

**Maven**
  - No further need to install Maven. We suggest using the Maven Wrapper defined in the `./rateme/` folder.

**Verify Installation**

After installation, ensure Docker, Docker Compose, Java, and `kubectl` are properly installed by checking their versions using the following commands:
  - Docker: `docker --version`
  - Docker Compose: `docker-compose --version`
  - Java: `java -version`
  - kubectl: `kubectl version --client`
    


## Development

### Build

Run `./mvnw clean package` to build the project.

### Run

Ensure you have rights to execute start script e.g with linux
```sh
  sudo chown +x start.sh   
```

This commmand will run the two docker-compose projects(Main Project and Monitoring project)
```sh
  ./start.sh


In development or testing it makes sense to start project manually with docker compose. 
Just run 

```sh
  docker compose up --build
```
to rebuild containers after changes.

Alternatively you can start services like db and frontend with docker compose
```sh
  docker compose up database frontend --build
```
and start springboot manually via terminal or vs code extension.

Make sure to run ./mvnw clean package from time to time
